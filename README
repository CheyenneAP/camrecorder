About:
======

Camrecorder it's a simple utility that aims to make a video stream using an
icecast server and record the video on files divided into several parts (one
video file per hour), everything at the same time.

Camrecorder it's to be used specially with surveillance cameras, where no audio
stream is necessary. Only video will be streamed and recorded.

Split files into several parts makes easy to search and handle videos,
Camrecorder also uses a timestamp format in file names.


How to use:
===========

Camrecorder was written in python, so all you need to run is:

	* Python
	* Gstreamer libraries and plugins (specially V4L2)
	* Python gstreamer bindings (python-gst)
	
	Of course a Icecast server is necessary to stream the videos.
	If you want to run by your own a Icecast server, please, see
	http://www.icecast.org/


Camrecorder arguments:

	-d | --device        Video device (i.e. /dev/video0)
	-a | --address       IP of Icecast source server (default 127.0.0.1)
	-p | --port          Icecast server port (default 8000)
	-m | --mount         Icecast mount point (default live.ogg)
	-s | --password      Icecast password
	-o | --output        Output file base name (default camrecorder-)

Example usage:

	./camrecorder.py -d /dev/video0 -a 192.168.1.10 -s foo -p 8000 -m garagecam.ogg -o /media/hd2/garage-

	The command above will stream from device /dev/video0 in a Icecast server
	running at 192.168.1.10 on port 8000, with password foo, and mount point
	garagecam.ogg.

	All video files will be saved in /media/hd2/garage-TIMESTAMP.ogg, where
	TIMESTAMP corresponds to the current date and time when the file was
	created.
